# Clinical Diagnostics Data Quality Dashboard (Python + MySQL)

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a beginner-friendly project that sets up the structure for a clinical diagnostics data quality dashboard.

It includes:
- Basic SQL folder for database structure
- Python starter script in the `src` folder
- Placeholder reports folder
- Clean and organized project layout
=======
This project simulates a clinical diagnostics lab environment and focuses on **data quality monitoring** using Python and MySQL.

It mirrors real laboratory workflows such as sample processing, QC checks, calibration review, and LIS-style documentation.

## Project Objectives

- Store **patient samples, test results, QC logs, and calibration data** in a MySQL database  
- Use **Python** to:
  - Detect outliers in biochemical analytes
  - Track daily QC pass/fail rates
  - Identify analyzer drift over time based on calibration logs
- Build simple dashboards and plots for:
  - Trends in abnormal values
  - Daily QC summary
- Export **automated daily PDF data quality reports**

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, mysql-connector-python, reportlab / matplotlib PdfPages  

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL schema design and joins for healthcare-style data  
- Data cleaning and anomaly detection  
- QC and calibration trend monitoring  
- Basic reporting and dashboard-style visualizations  
- Healthcare diagnostics domain understanding
